Hi,

The new user <%= @person.name %> just signed up and indicated that they are a member of the following projects and/or institutions:

<%= @details %>

If you know this person is a genuine member of a <%= t('project').downcase %> you administer, you can add them by:
    - following the link to the <%= t('project').downcase %> shown below
    - select the Administration menu
    - select the Administer <%= t('project') %> members button

Links to these <%= t('project').pluralize.downcase %> are:

<% @projects.each do |project| %>
    <%= project.title %> - <%= project_url(project) %>
<% end %>

If the institution does not exist, you can create the new institution. To do this:
    - Go to Institutions tab at <%= institutions_url %>
    - Click the 'New Institution' button

After the institution has been created successfully, you need to assign it to the <%= t('project').downcase %> following the steps described above.

If you need to contact the person, their details can be found at: <%= person_url(@person) %>, and their email address is <%= @person.email %> .
